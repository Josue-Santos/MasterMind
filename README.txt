The project is mainly built through vectors implementation. Strings are used to hold the list of combinations inside of the vectors. Also,
intengers are holding important values such as the counters and maximum and vector size. There is no special features that goes beyond 
for what the project is intended to be. Error messages are shown only in some specific cases or when the user input zero as a guess or
when numbers are out of range. Effeciently this program has the main goal of representing the master mind game using set of numbers 
istead of colors. Once the game starts, the user can exit it entering all zero combination or if the user get the right combination.
